Hey, Glad you are here. Welcome to my Golang Journey. After some time of research and peer pressureðŸ˜… from colleagues, i finally decided to learn it anyways.

> I will be updating this repo from time to time and adding more notes, resources and projects.ðŸ˜‰

# Environment Setup

In my case, i will be using Visual Studio Code as my editor on my windows machine. After installing VS Code, i then went ahead and installed go in my environment by downloading the windows installer from [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/). At the time of writing this, i am currently using `go version go1.17.6 windows/amd64`.

Back on my VS Code, we need to install go extension from the Extension Market. (_Specifically the one highlighted below._)

Once the installation completes, depending on your situation, you need to install extra tools which are missing if it's your first install. If you get errors, just select `Install all`. In my case, 9 tools were missing.

With that said and done, we are good to `GO`.
