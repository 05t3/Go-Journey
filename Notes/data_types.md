# Data Types

Golang is statically typed programming language meaning that each variable has a type. Go has several built in types that we will look into in this article. Data types in Go can be categorized into two types:

1. Basic Types
2. Composite Types

# 1. Basic Types

## Integers

### Signed

#### int

#### int8

#### int16

#### int32

#### int64

### Unsigned

#### uint

#### uint8

#### uint16

#### uint32

#### uint64

#### uintptr

### Floats

#### float32

#### float64

### Complex Numbers

#### complex64

#### complex128

### Byte

### Rune

### String

### Boolean

# 2. Composite Types

## Collection/Aggregation or Non-Reference Types

### Arrays

### Structs

## Reference Types

### Slices

### Maps

### Channels

### Pointers

### Function/Methods

## Interface

### Special case of empty Interface
